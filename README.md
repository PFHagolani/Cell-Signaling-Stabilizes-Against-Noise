# Cell-Signaling-Stabilizes-Against-Noise

In this repository you will find:

1. The EmbryoMaker code used to run the developmental simulations.

   The EmbryoMaker code can be found in the EmbryoMaker.devo folder. This folder includes the code, which is located in /src/core and a bash file that can be used to compile EmbryoMaker, the executable will be located in the folder /bin.
	 
	 This version of EmbryoMaker is similar to the original one, it just includes a couple modifications:
	 
	 A. Automatic ending conditions that will stop the simulation. For details on these conditions see the supplementary information of https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.179309. 
	
	B. Some of the genes dynamics have been simplified. For details on these conditions see the supplementary information of https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.179309. 

2. Initial developmental pattern of each of the ensembles used in the article

	These can be found in the folder /InitialDevoPatterns
