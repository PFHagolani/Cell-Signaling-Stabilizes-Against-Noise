In this repository you will find:

1. The EmbryoMaker code used to run the developmental simulations.

   The EmbryoMaker code can be found in the EmbryoMaker.devo folder. This folder includes the code, which is located in /src/core and a bash file that can be use to compile EmbryoMaker, the executable will be located in the folder /bin.
	 
	 This version of EmbryoMaker is similar to the original one, it includes just a couple modifications:
	 
	 A. Automatic ending conditions that will stop the simulation. For details on these conditions see the suplementary information of "ARTICLE LINK". 
	 B. Some of the genes dynamics have been simplified. For details on these conditions see the suplementary information of "ARTICLE LINK". 

2. Complex morphologies of each of the ensembles used in the article
